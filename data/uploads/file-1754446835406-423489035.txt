SALESFORCE CASE CLOSURE PROCESS - OVERVIEW AND FRAMEWORK
Version 2.1 | Effective Date: August 2025 | Department: Customer Success

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document establishes the comprehensive framework for closing customer support cases in Salesforce, ensuring consistent service delivery, proper documentation, and customer satisfaction. The new process emphasizes quality over speed, customer communication, and thorough resolution verification.

PROCESS OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of our case closure process are:
- Ensure complete resolution of customer issues before case closure
- Maintain high customer satisfaction scores through proper follow-up
- Create comprehensive documentation for future reference and knowledge sharing
- Reduce case reopening rates by 40% through thorough verification procedures
- Establish clear accountability and ownership throughout the resolution lifecycle
- Provide accurate reporting and analytics for continuous process improvement

CASE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW
Every customer support case follows a structured lifecycle from initial contact to final closure. The lifecycle consists of six primary stages: Case Creation, Initial Assessment, Investigation and Resolution, Customer Communication, Solution Verification, and Final Closure. Each stage has specific requirements, timelines, and quality checkpoints that must be completed before progression to the next stage.

CASE CREATION AND INTAKE
When a new case is created in Salesforce, it automatically enters our tracking system with a unique case number. The initial intake process requires assignment of priority level based on business impact and urgency. Priority levels are defined as Critical (P1), High (P2), Medium (P3), and Low (P4), each with corresponding response time requirements. Critical cases require immediate response within 2 hours, while low priority cases have a 48-hour response window.

PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
Critical Priority (P1) cases involve system outages affecting multiple users, security breaches, or issues preventing core business operations. These cases require immediate escalation to senior technical staff and continuous monitoring until resolution. High Priority (P2) cases affect significant business functions but have workarounds available. Medium Priority (P3) cases involve standard technical issues or feature requests with minimal business impact. Low Priority (P4) cases typically include general inquiries, documentation requests, or minor cosmetic issues.

ASSIGNMENT AND OWNERSHIP
Every case must have a designated case owner responsible for end-to-end resolution. Case assignment considers agent expertise, current workload, and case complexity. Senior agents handle P1 and P2 cases, while junior agents may work on P3 and P4 cases under supervision. Case ownership cannot be transferred without proper documentation of current status, attempted solutions, and next steps.

INITIAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
The initial response to customers must acknowledge receipt of their case, confirm understanding of the issue, and provide expected resolution timeframes. This response should be personalized and avoid generic templates. Agents must review any previous cases from the same customer to understand historical context and potential recurring issues. The initial response also includes gathering additional information if the original case description lacks necessary details.

INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY
Case investigation follows a systematic approach beginning with reproduction of the reported issue in a controlled environment. Agents must document all troubleshooting steps, including unsuccessful attempts, to build a comprehensive resolution path. Collaboration with internal teams such as engineering, product management, or security may be required for complex technical issues. All internal communications and findings must be logged in the case notes for future reference.

SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT
Once the root cause is identified, agents develop appropriate solutions considering customer environment, technical constraints, and business requirements. Solutions may include configuration changes, software updates, procedural modifications, or alternative approaches. All proposed solutions must be tested and validated before implementation. For complex solutions requiring customer action, detailed implementation guides must be prepared.

CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION STANDARDS
Throughout the case lifecycle, customers must receive regular updates on progress, even when no significant developments have occurred. Communication frequency depends on case priority: P1 cases require daily updates, P2 cases need updates every 2-3 days, and P3/P4 cases should have weekly communication. All communications must be professional, clear, and include specific next steps or expected timelines.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION
When implementing solutions, agents must coordinate with customers to minimize business disruption. This includes scheduling maintenance windows, providing backup procedures, and ensuring necessary stakeholders are informed. Implementation steps must be documented in detail, including any deviations from the original plan. Customers should be guided through implementation steps when their involvement is required.

VERIFICATION AND TESTING
After solution implementation, comprehensive verification ensures the original issue is completely resolved. This includes functional testing, performance validation, and confirmation that no new issues were introduced. Customers must actively confirm that the solution meets their requirements and resolves the reported problem. Verification may require extended monitoring periods for complex issues or system-wide changes.

KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTRIBUTION
Every resolved case should contribute to our organizational knowledge base. Agents must create or update knowledge articles for common issues, unique solutions, or complex procedures. These articles help reduce resolution time for similar future cases and enable customer self-service options. Knowledge articles must be reviewed and approved by senior team members before publication.

CASE CLOSURE CRITERIA
Cases can only be closed when all resolution criteria are met: the original issue is completely resolved, the customer confirms satisfaction with the solution, all documentation is complete and accurate, any necessary follow-up tasks are scheduled, and internal quality reviews are passed. Partial resolutions or workarounds cannot trigger case closure unless explicitly accepted by the customer and approved by management.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MEASUREMENT
Prior to case closure, customers receive satisfaction surveys covering resolution quality, communication effectiveness, and overall experience. Survey responses are reviewed and any negative feedback triggers additional investigation and potential case reopening. Satisfaction scores below acceptable thresholds require supervisor review and corrective action plans.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS
A random sampling of closed cases undergoes quality assurance review to ensure adherence to process standards. QA reviews examine documentation completeness, solution appropriateness, customer communication quality, and compliance with established procedures. Cases failing QA review may be reopened for additional work or used as training examples for process improvement.

REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
Comprehensive reporting tracks key performance indicators including case volume, resolution times, customer satisfaction scores, and first-contact resolution rates. Monthly reports identify trends, highlight successful practices, and pinpoint areas requiring improvement. Team performance metrics are reviewed in regular meetings to ensure continuous process optimization.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
The case closure process undergoes regular review and refinement based on customer feedback, team input, and performance metrics. Process improvements are documented, communicated to all team members, and incorporated into training materials. Regular training sessions ensure all team members understand current procedures and best practices.

ESCALATION PROCEDURES
Clear escalation paths exist for cases requiring additional expertise, management approval, or customer relationship management. Escalation criteria include technical complexity beyond agent capabilities, customer dissatisfaction with proposed solutions, or cases approaching service level agreement deadlines. Escalated cases maintain all original documentation while adding senior-level oversight and resources.

COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
All case closure activities must comply with internal policies, industry regulations, and customer contractual agreements. Regular audits verify compliance with established procedures and identify potential risks or process gaps. Compliance documentation is maintained for all closed cases and made available for internal and external audit purposes.
