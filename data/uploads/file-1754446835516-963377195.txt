SALESFORCE CASE CLOSURE - DETAILED PROCEDURES AND WORKFLOWS
Version 2.1 | Effective Date: August 2025 | Department: Customer Success Operations

DETAILED CLOSURE WORKFLOW PROCEDURES

PRE-CLOSURE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Before initiating the case closure process, agents must complete a comprehensive verification checklist ensuring all resolution requirements are satisfied. This checklist includes confirming the original issue is completely resolved, verifying customer acceptance of the solution, ensuring all case documentation is complete and accurate, checking that any promised follow-up actions are scheduled, and validating that internal quality standards are met.

The verification process begins with a thorough review of the case history, including all customer communications, internal notes, and attempted solutions. Agents must confirm that the final solution directly addresses the root cause identified during investigation. Any temporary workarounds or partial solutions must be clearly documented with timelines for permanent resolution.

CUSTOMER CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS
Customer confirmation is mandatory before case closure and must include explicit acknowledgment that the original issue is resolved, confirmation that the solution meets business requirements, and agreement that no additional support is needed for this specific issue. This confirmation should be obtained through direct communication such as email, phone call, or customer portal response.

When customers are unresponsive to confirmation requests, agents must make at least three contact attempts over a five-business-day period using different communication methods. If no response is received, cases may be closed with supervisor approval, but must include detailed documentation of all contact attempts and be flagged for follow-up monitoring.

DOCUMENTATION COMPLETION STANDARDS
Complete case documentation requires a clear problem statement describing the original issue in customer terms, detailed investigation notes including all troubleshooting steps performed, comprehensive solution description with implementation details, customer communication log with dates and methods used, and any relevant attachments or screenshots supporting the resolution.

All case notes must be written in clear, professional language that future agents can understand and follow. Technical jargon should be explained or avoided, and all acronyms must be defined on first use. Internal communications and customer-facing communications should be clearly distinguished in case notes.

SALESFORCE FIELD REQUIREMENTS
Specific Salesforce fields must be completed before case closure including case resolution summary, resolution category selection, time spent on resolution, customer satisfaction rating, and knowledge article references if applicable. The resolution summary should provide a concise but comprehensive overview that enables quick understanding of the issue and solution without reading the entire case history.

Resolution categories must accurately reflect the type of issue resolved to enable proper reporting and trend analysis. Categories include technical configuration, software bug, user training, hardware issue, process improvement, and feature request. Accurate categorization helps identify common issues and opportunities for proactive improvements.

SOLUTION VALIDATION PROCEDURES
Solution validation requires testing the implemented solution in the customer's specific environment when possible, confirming that the solution doesn't negatively impact other system functions, verifying that all acceptance criteria defined during case investigation are met, and ensuring the solution aligns with established best practices and security requirements.

For complex technical solutions, validation may require extended monitoring periods to ensure stability and performance. Critical system changes require post-implementation reviews at 24-hour, 72-hour, and one-week intervals to confirm continued proper operation.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION
Every closed case contributes to organizational knowledge through creation or updates to knowledge base articles, documentation of new procedures or configurations, identification of product improvement opportunities, and contribution to FAQ and self-service content development.

Knowledge articles must include clear problem descriptions, step-by-step solution procedures, prerequisites and requirements, potential complications or alternative approaches, and related articles or documentation. Articles undergo peer review before publication to ensure accuracy and clarity.

QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS
Quality assurance occurs at multiple points throughout the closure process including pre-closure documentation review, solution appropriateness validation, customer communication assessment, and post-closure random audit selection. Quality checks ensure consistency across all cases and identify opportunities for agent development and process improvement.

QA failures require immediate correction and may result in case reopening if deficiencies significantly impact solution quality or customer satisfaction. Patterns of QA failures trigger additional training and coaching for individual agents or teams.

AUTOMATED WORKFLOW TRIGGERS
Salesforce automation supports the closure process through automatic field validation, required field enforcement, workflow rule execution for specific case types, and integration with external systems for reporting and analytics. Automation reduces manual errors and ensures consistent application of closure procedures.

Automated triggers also initiate follow-up activities such as customer satisfaction survey distribution, knowledge base update notifications, and performance metric calculations. These automated processes improve efficiency while maintaining quality standards.

EXCEPTION HANDLING PROCEDURES
Certain cases require special handling procedures including cases involving legal or compliance issues, customer escalations requiring executive involvement, technical issues requiring vendor engagement, and cases with contractual or service level agreement implications.

Exception cases follow modified workflows with additional approval requirements, enhanced documentation standards, and specialized escalation procedures. All exceptions must be approved by designated supervisors and include detailed justification for deviation from standard procedures.

CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COORDINATION
Case closure often requires coordination with other departments including engineering for technical validation, legal for compliance review, sales for customer relationship considerations, and product management for feature requests or enhancements.

Coordination procedures include defined handoff points, clear communication protocols, established timelines for cross-functional reviews, and escalation procedures for delayed responses. All cross-functional activities must be documented in case notes with responsible parties and expected completion dates.

CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES
Standardized communication templates ensure consistent messaging while allowing personalization for specific situations. Templates include case closure notifications, solution implementation guides, follow-up instructions, and satisfaction survey invitations.

Templates must be customized for each case with specific details about the resolution, any ongoing requirements, and contact information for future questions. Generic or unmodified templates are not acceptable for customer communications.

PERFORMANCE METRICS AND TRACKING
Key performance indicators for case closure include time from solution implementation to case closure, customer satisfaction scores for closed cases, case reopening rates within 30 days, quality assurance pass rates, and knowledge article creation rates.

Performance metrics are tracked at individual, team, and organizational levels with regular reporting and trend analysis. Metrics inform training needs, process improvements, and resource allocation decisions.

TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
All agents must complete case closure training before handling customer cases independently. Training covers process procedures, documentation standards, customer communication best practices, and quality requirements. Ongoing training addresses process updates, common issues, and performance improvement opportunities.

Certification requires successful completion of written assessments and practical case closure exercises under supervision. Recertification occurs annually or when significant process changes are implemented.

AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE MONITORING
Regular audits verify adherence to case closure procedures and identify potential compliance risks. Audit scope includes documentation accuracy, procedure compliance, customer communication quality, and system utilization. Audit findings trigger corrective action plans and process improvement initiatives.

Compliance monitoring ensures adherence to internal policies, industry regulations, and customer contractual requirements. Compliance violations are reported immediately and may result in case reopening or additional remediation activities.

POST-CLOSURE MONITORING
Closed cases are monitored for 30 days to identify potential issues such as customer dissatisfaction, solution failures, or recurring problems. Monitoring includes automated alerts for case reopening requests, customer satisfaction survey responses below acceptable thresholds, and related case creation from the same customer.

Post-closure monitoring enables proactive identification and resolution of issues before they impact customer relationships or require escalation. Monitoring results inform process improvements and training needs.
